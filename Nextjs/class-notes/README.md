# What is Next.js, and how is it different from React?
# Answer:
## Next.js is a React-based open-source framework that helps developers build server-side rendered React applications.

# The key difference between React and Next.js is the way they handle routing. React uses client-side routing, meaning the page transitions are handled entirely on the client-side using JavaScript.

# In contrast, Next.js provides server-side routing, which means that the server handles the routing and sends the pre-rendered pages to the client, resulting in faster page loads and better SEO.

# Next.js also provides additional features like automatic code splitting, static site generation, and dynamic imports.
